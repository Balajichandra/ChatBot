Basically, the ferroresonant action is a flux limiter rather than a voltage regulator. Nonetheless, with a fairly constant supply frequency, the CVT can maintain an almost constant output voltage even as the input voltage varies widely"

            "K-factor is a weighting of the harmonic load currents according to their effects on transformer heating.  A K-factor of 1.0 indicates a linear load (no harmonics). The higher the K-factor, the greater the harmonic heating effects. The K-Factor is used by transformer manufacturers and their customers to adjust the load rating as a function of the harmonic currents caused by the load(s). Transformers are offered with different K-Factors (K-4, K-7, K-13 & K-20) standard. The K-Factor is a means of rating the transformer's ability to withstand the heating effects of harmonic and fundamental current flowing in the transformer. Utilization of the proper K-Factor is absolutely essential in every installation. If too low a K-Factor is used, it can result in failure, fire, overheating, and wave form distortion"
